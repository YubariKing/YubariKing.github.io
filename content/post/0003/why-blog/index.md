I think it's worth explaining why I even have this blog and what motivates me to write here. 

Two of my friends a while back started their own blogs, in which they post basically anything on their minds. I considered doing the same, but I thought I wanted my blog to be different. Not that I don't think using a blog as a brain dump is bad, it's just that I thought I could use it for a different purpose.

I figured what if I started to write about a specific topic I wish to become well-versed in. Being able to research a topic then condense it into a short blog post has many benefits. I am forced to read about a certain topic and gain a solid understanding of it so I can explain it. Then, by writing the concept in my own words, I reinforce my own understanding and also learn to articulate these concepts better. So, I thought why not supplement my learning in physics (which is what I'll be studying in university) by creating this blog. And the best part is I can write about whatever I want. It serves as an outlet for me to explore niches in physics that catch my attention.

So that means I am not intending to please an audience. I only work to please God anyways (sometimes this involves pleasing others). I will most likely share posts with friends and family and keep it at that. But the idea of random people reading these posts don't bother me in the slightest.

And that's about it. Of course I will occasionally throw in some random topics of my liking, but the goal is to consistently work on a physics post without worrying about how often I publish them (the topic dictates how long it takes to make a post). I will inshAllah keep myself in check, as I have already failed by posting once in February then taking a 3-month break. Discipline is a learned skill, and I have been diligently working on it. We shall see what happens.

Also, to anyone that reads these posts, I hope you find some benefit in them. If you ever wish to ask me any questions, I would be happy to answer them. You can check the contact page and send me an email.
