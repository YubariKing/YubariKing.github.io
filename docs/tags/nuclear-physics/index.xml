        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;radioactivity&#34;&gt;Radioactivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes some atoms radioactive? An atom is radioactive when the nucleus is unstable. The stability of the nucleus is determined by two forces: the electrostatic force and the strong nuclear force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrostatic force is exchanged between charged particles, and since protons are the only charged particle in the nucleus they repel (like-charges repel). The strong nuclear force that works over very short distances (it&amp;rsquo;s negligible with distances greater than a nucleus) is what counteracts the electrostatic force and thus what keeps the protons from flying apart. This force is acting to pull the nucleons together (protons and neutrons are collectively called nucleons) of the element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in short, an element is radioactive when the electrostatic force and strong nuclear force aren&amp;rsquo;t in equilibrium. If they are, the element is considered stable. The neutron-to-proton ratio determines whether the element is stable or not. There are a few other factors that contribute to this stability such as binding energy, but for the most part this is how stability of an atom works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;radioactive-elements-on-the-periodic-table&#34;&gt;Radioactive Elements on the Periodic Table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An element on the periodic table marked as radioactive indicates it&amp;rsquo;s most abundant isotope in nature is radioactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means a radioactive element can have stable isotopes, they are just less abundant in nature. Conversely, a stable element can have radioactive isotopes (common example is Carbon-14.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the periodic table, most of the radioactive elements are heavier than Bismuth as the electrostatic force starts to dominate the strong nuclear force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-radioactive-decay&#34;&gt;Types of Radioactive Decay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an atom is radioactive, it is going to undergo some form of decay to become stable. The different decay processes may involve the nucleus emitting or absorbing some particles to become more stable. In both cases, some radiation (emission of particles or waves) is released no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all decay processes, the atom may either decay into a different isotope or transmute into a new element. There are three most common types of radioactive decay, named after the first three letters of the greek alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the only reason these decay processes are named greek letters is because the scientists who discovered them didn&amp;rsquo;t know what type of radiation was being emitted. Otherwise, they probably would have been named something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alpha-decay&#34;&gt;Alpha Decay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In alpha decay, an unstable nucleus releases 2 protons and 2 neutrons, or essentially a helium-4 nucleus. It&amp;rsquo;s common for elements with an overpowering electrostatic force (mainly in heavier elements) to undergo alpha decay. Notice how releasing a helium-4 nucleus reduces the electrostatic force more than the strong nuclear force, allowing for the nucleus to stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;beta-decay&#34;&gt;Beta Decay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of beta decay. Beta-minus decay is when a neutron converts into a proton, and thus emits a electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino. Beta-plus decay is when the opposite happens, a proton converts into a neutron, thus releasing a positron and neutrino. From these processes it&amp;rsquo;s possible for an element to transmute into a heavier or lighter element.&lt;/p&gt;
